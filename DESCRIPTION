Title: Implementation of Parametric Formulas for Soil Water Retention or
    Conductivity Curve
Type: Package
Author: Emanuele Cordano, Daniele Andreis, Fabio Zottele
Description: It is a set of R implementations of parametric formulas of soil
    water retention or conductivity curve. At the moment, only Van Genuchten
    (for soil water retention curve) and Mualem (for hydraulic conductivity)
    were implemented. See reference (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Water_retention_curve>).
