Title: soilwater: Implements parametric formulas for soil water retention or
    conductivity curve
Type: Package
Author: Emanuele Cordano, Daniele Andreis, Fabio Zottele
Description: It contains implementations of parametric formulas for soil water
    retention or conductivity curve. At the moment, only Van Genuchten (for
    soil water retention curve) and Mualem (for hydraulic conductivity) were
    implemented. See reference
    \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_retention_curve}. Any contributions
    or suggestions are warmly welcomed.
